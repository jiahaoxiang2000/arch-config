## linux-zen Kernel

### Overview

The linux-zen kernel is a community-maintained Arch kernel variant, tuned for better responsiveness and interactivity on desktop systems. It includes additional patches and tweaks for improved desktop and workstation performance.

### Installation

To install the linux-zen kernel and its headers, run:

```fish
sudo pacman -S linux-zen linux-zen-headers
```

After installation, reboot your system and select the linux-zen kernel from your bootloader menu (systemd-boot, GRUB, etc).

> **Tip:** With systemd-boot, use the arrow keys at boot to choose 'Arch Linux (linux-zen)' from the list. If you want linux-zen as the default, edit `/boot/loader/loader.conf` and set `default arch-*linux-zen*` (the exact entry name may vary, check `/boot/loader/entries/`).

### Notes

- The linux-zen kernel is compatible with most desktop hardware and drivers.
- If you use DKMS modules (such as NVIDIA or custom drivers), the headers package is required.
- You can always switch back to the standard Arch kernel from your boot menu if needed.

## Maximizing Intel CPU Frequency on Linux

### Overview

To maximize the performance of your Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7820X CPU on Linux, you can set the CPU frequency governor to 'performance' and ensure Intel Turbo Boost is enabled. This will allow your CPU to run at its highest possible frequency under load.

### Steps

1. **Install cpupower**

   ```fish
   sudo pacman -S cpupower
   ```

2. **Set the CPU governor to performance**

   ```fish
   sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
   ```

   This sets all CPU cores to use the 'performance' governor, maximizing frequency.

3. **Check Turbo Boost status**

   Turbo Boost should be enabled by default. To check:

   ```fish
   cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
   ```

   - If the output is `0`, Turbo Boost is enabled.
   - If the output is `1`, Turbo Boost is disabled (enable it in your BIOS/UEFI).

4. **Verify current frequency and governor**

   ```fish
   cpupower frequency-info | head -20
   ```

   - Look for `current policy: frequency should be within ...` and `The governor "performance"`.
   - Check `boost state support: Active: yes` for Turbo Boost.

### Notes

- For true overclocking (beyond Intel Turbo Boost), you must adjust settings in your motherboard's BIOS/UEFI.
- Monitor CPU temperatures and system stability if you push frequencies higher.
- The linux-zen kernel is optimized for desktop responsiveness and works well with these settings.
- Use `cpupower frequency-info` to monitor CPU scaling at any time.

## CPU Benchmarking

### Overview

To benchmark your CPU performance and compare with others, you can use Geekbench (for easy online comparison) or sysbench (open-source, CLI-based).

### Geekbench (Recommended)

1. Install Geekbench using yay:
   ```fish
   yay -S geekbench
   ```
2. Run Geekbench:
   ```fish
   geekbench
   ```
3. After the test, you'll get a link to your results online for easy comparison with other CPUs.

we get the result on the [online](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/11981510), 1451 Single-Core Score 7180 Multi-Core Score.

#### Performance Comparison

| CPU                                                                | Single-Core | Multi-Core |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| i7-7820X [yours](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/11981510)    | 1451        | 7180       |
| i7-7820X [Auto OC](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12025481)  | 1528        | 7541       |
| [AMD Ryzen 7 9700X](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/11974922) | 3478        | 19177      |

- The AMD Ryzen 7 9700X, which on May 2025 1300 Yuan, is about **2.2x faster** in single-core and **3x faster** in multi-core performance compared to your i7-7820X (based on Geekbench 6).
- Your CPU is still strong for its generation, but modern high-end CPUs deliver much higher scores, especially in multi-threaded workloads.
- For more comparisons, see the [Geekbench Browser](https://browser.geekbench.com/).

## Wechat

### Fcitx5 Input Method Not Working in Wechat

If you find that the fcitx5 input method does not work in Wechat (even though the fcitx5 process is running), the likely cause is missing environment variables in the Wechat desktop entry.

#### Solution

Update the Wechat desktop file to set the required environment variables for input method support:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's|^Exec=.*|Exec=env GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx /opt/wechat/wechat %U|' /usr/share/applications/wechat.desktop
```

This command ensures that Wechat is started with the correct environment for fcitx5 to function properly.

## OBS Streaming to Bilibili Live

> **Background:** Starting from 2025-05-26, Bilibili will restrict third-party streaming software for users with fewer than 5000 fans. On Linux, OBS is commonly used for streaming, so a workaround is needed to continue streaming.

### Workaround: Use Windows Client to Start Stream, Then Push from Linux OBS

This method requires two computers: one running Windows and the other running Linux.

Steps:

1. **Start the Stream on Windows:**
   - Use the official Bilibili Live client on your Windows machine to start the stream.
   - After the stream is started, you can close the Bilibili Live application.

2. **Stream from Linux with OBS:**
   - On your Linux machine, open OBS.
   - Set the stream key and stream address in OBS. Note that the stream key does **not** auto-refresh, so you can obtain it from the Bilibili web interface before the third-party streaming restriction takes effect.
   - Start streaming from OBS as usual.

**Note:** This workaround was tested, but may not work if Bilibili enforces stricter policies in the future.

## ISSUE

- [x] When launching applications via `.desktop` files (for example, using `wofi`), environment variables set in your shell (like fish) or in `hyprland.conf` are **not** passed to those applications.
  - Here we to change the `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile` to set the environment variables, then it works, here not the know what the file to work. the `config.fish` is can work on the application, but need the machine restart.
- As a result, input methods (such as fcitx5) or other environment-dependent features may not work as expected in apps started this way.
