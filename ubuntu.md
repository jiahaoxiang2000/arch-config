# Ubuntu

This is issue collection for Ubuntu Desktop.

> here we used Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

## shutdown ubuntu is paused

when we used Ubuntu UI supported `Power Off` or `Suspend`, then the system not shutdown or suspend. For the `Power Off` button clicked, then the system is to in one exit background, but the long time not shutdown.

### Investigations

- _2025-05-10 08:36:45 HKT_ not find the root cause.
- _2025-05-15 08:39:28 HKT_ identified potential issues that could cause shutdown problems. **So we want to back use Arch-linux.**
