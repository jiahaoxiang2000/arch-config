# compose

Docker Compose stacks for the self-hosted servers in this config, organized one
directory per service — the container counterpart to [`systemd/user/`](../systemd/user).

Unlike `systemd/`, no tool auto-reads this folder; each stack is started
explicitly:

```sh
docker compose -f compose/<service>/compose.yaml up -d
```

## Services

| ------- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| [`iread/`](iread/) | `ghcr.io/isomoes/iread:latest` | `127.0.0.1:9999` | `systemd/user/iread.service` |
| [`agentsview/`](agentsview/) | `ghcr.io/kenn-io/agentsview:latest` | `127.0.0.1:8585` | `systemd/user/agentsview.service` |

| [`frpc/`](frpc/) | `snowdreamtech/frpc` | host netns (dials out to `frps`) | — (new) |
| [`caddy/`](caddy/) | `caddy:2-alpine` | HTTP `127.0.0.1:80` via host netns | Friendly `*.localhost` URLs |

## Updating images

Pull and deploy a new image manually with:

```sh
docker compose -f compose/<service>/compose.yaml pull
docker compose -f compose/<service>/compose.yaml up -d
```

The running container is left untouched if the pull fails. Run the explicit
`pull` command above whenever you want to check for and install an update.

### caddy

Caddy provides memorable local names for services that otherwise require port
numbers. It uses host networking so it can proxy to servers bound to
`127.0.0.1`, while `default_bind 127.0.0.1` keeps Caddy itself local-only.
Start it with:

```sh
docker compose -f ~/.config/compose/caddy/compose.yaml up -d
```

Configured routes:

- `http://ikanban.localhost` → `127.0.0.1:9090`
- `http://iread.localhost` → `127.0.0.1:9999`
- `http://agentsview.localhost` → `127.0.0.1:8585`
- `http://daed.localhost` → `127.0.0.1:2023`

Every route accepts only loopback clients and either its own `*.localhost`
browser origin or an origin-less local request. Requests from another website
origin receive HTTP 403. For accepted IKanban browser requests, Caddy rewrites
upstream `Host` and `Origin` headers to the loopback origin expected by DSH's
request-forgery protection.

This protects access through Caddy only. Each upstream should also bind directly
to `127.0.0.1`; otherwise its numbered port can bypass Caddy. In particular,
daed must be started with `--listen 127.0.0.1:2023` instead of its default
`0.0.0.0:2023` listener.

Add more routes to `caddy/Caddyfile`, then apply them with:

```sh
docker compose -f ~/.config/compose/caddy/compose.yaml exec caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

`*.localhost` resolves to loopback in modern browsers, so no `/etc/hosts` or DNS
changes are required.

### iread

The image stores its SQLite db and OPML mirror in `/data`; the compose file
bind-mounts `~/.config/iread` there, so the container reuses the same
`iread.db` + `feeds.opml` the systemd service used. Cut over with:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now iread.service
docker compose -f compose/iread/compose.yaml up -d   # http://localhost:9999
```

To test without disturbing the running service, point a throwaway container at a
copy of the data on a spare port:

```sh
cp -a ~/.config/iread /tmp/iread-testdata
docker run --rm -p 8788:8787 -v /tmp/iread-testdata:/data ghcr.io/isomoes/iread:latest
# open http://localhost:8788, then Ctrl-C
```

### agentsview

A read-only viewer: it bind-mounts your agent session dirs (`~/.claude/projects`,
`~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.local/share/opencode`) read-only and re-indexes them
into its own SQLite archive in the named `agentsview-data` volume — so there is
nothing to migrate, and your session files are never written to. Cut over:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now agentsview.service
docker compose -f compose/agentsview/compose.yaml up -d   # http://127.0.0.1:8585
```

Gotcha baked into the compose file: agentsview only honors API requests whose
`Host` is in an allowlist derived from its **container** port (8080). Because the
host port differs (8585), every `/api/*` call 403s unless the server is started
with `--public-url http://127.0.0.1:8585` to register the real browser origin.
Add a source dir by mounting it read-only under `/agents/<name>` and setting the
matching `*_DIR` env (see the upstream `docker-compose.prod.yaml`).

### kookeey-bridge

Two [gost](https://github.com/go-gost/gost) containers expose an HTTP proxy on
`127.0.0.1:10011` and a SOCKS5 proxy on `127.0.0.1:10012`. Each forwards requests
through its own authenticated Kookeey **SOCKS5** gateway (`gate.kookeey.info`).
Point a compatible client at the channel you want to use:

```sh
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10011 HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10011
curl https://api.ipify.org    # shows the Kookeey exit IP

curl --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:10012 https://api.ipify.org
```

The upstream URL contains your Kookeey username/password, so it is **not** in
`compose.yaml`. They live in `kookeey-bridge/.env` (gitignored via
`compose/**/.env`) as `KOOKEEY_UPSTREAM` for port 10011 and
`KOOKEEY_UPSTREAM_10012` for port 10012. Compose auto-loads them from the compose
file's own directory. Set them up once, then start the stack:

```sh
cd compose/kookeey-bridge && cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env   # fill in both channels
docker compose -f compose/kookeey-bridge/compose.yaml up -d
```

Both upstream variables use this format. `PORT` is the **gateway** port Kookeey
assigned that channel, not local port 10011 or 10012:

```
socks5://USERNAME:PASSWORD@gate.kookeey.info:PORT
```

If either upstream variable is unset, `up` aborts immediately with a message
naming the variable to configure rather than starting a broken proxy.

**Networking:** unlike the other stacks, this one uses `network_mode: host`
rather than a published `ports:` mapping. Docker's bridge network has no
outbound egress on this host — forwarded/NAT'd container traffic never leaves,
even though the host itself reaches the internet and `systemctl restart docker`
doesn't fix it — so gost runs in the host network namespace and reaches the
Kookeey gateway directly. Because host mode ignores `ports:`, the loopback-only
binds live in each service's `-L` argument, keeping both proxies reachable only
from this host. If bridge egress is ever repaired, revert to `ports:` mappings
and wildcard container binds to match the other stacks.

### frpc

An [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) **client** that reverse-tunnels this
host's SSH port out through a public `frps` server, so you can `ssh` back into
this NAT'd/firewalled machine from anywhere. frpc dials the `frps` server and
asks it to listen on `remotePort`; connections there are forwarded back down the
tunnel to `127.0.0.1:22` here. Set it up once, then start it:

```sh
cd compose/frpc && cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env   # frps addr, token, remote port
docker compose -f compose/frpc/compose.yaml up -d
# then from elsewhere:  ssh -p <FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT> <user>@<FRP_SERVER_ADDR>
```

Like `kookeey-bridge`, this stack uses `network_mode: host` — not for a
published port (frpc dials out, it never listens on the LAN) but because this
host's Docker bridge network has no outbound egress, so a bridged frpc could
never reach the `frps` server. Host mode also lets it reach the host's own sshd
directly at `127.0.0.1:22`.

Config split, same convention as the other stacks: the committed
[`frpc.toml`](frpc/frpc.toml) carries only the structure, referencing every
deployment value via frp's `{{ .Envs.* }}` env templating; the real values
(`frps` address, **auth token**, remote port) live in the gitignored
`compose/frpc/.env` (matched by `compose/**/.env`) and are injected into the
container by `compose.yaml`, where frpc renders them at startup. Required vars
are `:?`-guarded, so `up` aborts naming the missing one rather than starting a
misconfigured tunnel. TOML config needs frp ≥ v0.52, which the `:latest` image
satisfies.

**Security:** this publishes a route to your SSH port on the public `frps` host
(`<FRP_SERVER_ADDR>:<FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT>`). Use key-only auth and a strong,
unique `frps` token.
